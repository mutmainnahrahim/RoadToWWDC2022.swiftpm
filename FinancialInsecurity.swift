While we can only be connoisseurs of their pleasure. They can go wherever they want, they can buy whatever they want, even happiness they can buy. Money today is everything. People can have many friends, can do facials, can buy branded goods and be liked by many people. Sometimes financial deficiency becomes a problem for the emergence of a sense of inferiority in socializing because it is considered stupid and not slang.\n\nIf you still think like that, try to reveal the following husband and wife story. In their old age, Baharudin and Nuripas have not been able to enjoy their old age happily. The two husband and wife couples continue to be in misery. Since the last ten years this small family has no income and is sickly. But the attention of the government never arrived. His voice was hoarse when he spoke. His eyes did not stop shedding tears, when he told the sufferings of life that he had experienced in the last ten years. The lines of sadness on his face clearly radiated from his face that was no longer young. Every now and then Baharudin wipes the tears that trickle down his wrinkled cheeks with shaking hands. This grandparents couple with 5 children and 10 grandchildren who live in RT 03 RW 11 Sidomulyo Barat Village, Tampan District, Pekanbaru City have been without income for almost 10 years. This is because the grandfather is sickly. Practically since then, he can no longer work. His life became miserable. This condition is certainly in contrast to the face of Pekanbaru City which looks beautiful and majestic, because it has been preening since almost the last 10 years. The grandfather is now only able to continue his life in a semi-permanent house with clapboard walls full of sorrow and pain. It's hard to eat right now, my mother is sick too, said Baharudin, to Riau Pos (Jawa Pos Group), Sunday (26/4). diabetes (diabetes). Even though he is in a poor condition, this candidate for receiving social assistance (bansos) from the Pekanbaru City Government has not yet received it. This is due to the slow distribution reaching the village level. Even though Baharudin and his small family really hope for assistance from the government to ease their burden on life. The name Baharudin himself has actually been proposed by the head of the RT to the local RW, but the realization of the policy makers at the top level is nil. about 4 months ago and often hospitalized, the economic condition of this small family is getting worse due to the lack of funds and guarantees that can support the life of this elderly couple. I've been hospitalized 3 times, he said. In the past, for medical expenses, this family only relied on government insurance costs. However, since the increase in BPJS contributions, this family has not been able to pay for it. around. But it can't be expected further to sustain and face this harsh life.\n\nDon't follow other people's lifestyles that are too luxurious. Be yourself because happiness doesn't have to be expensive.")
